## Introduction

Papy is an open-source command line tool API load testing tool that is meant to be light weight, fast, and flexible.

### Key Features
Some of the key features include:
- Customized targetting (server address and endpoint)
- Customizable payloads
- Pseudo randomized payloads
- Verbose or compact response reporting
- HTTP and HTTPS traffic capabilities
- Traffic controls
  - Spike traffic
  - Ramp traffic
  - Rate limited traffic


### Target Audience
If you are a user familiar with a CLI then you can use this tool! It was intentionally developed to be: 
- Simple to use
- Easy to integrate with other tooling
- Light weight

## Getting Started

### Installation
The following is a step-by-step set of instructions for installing or accessing Papy.

First things first is to clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/noahpop77/Papy.git
```

Then you need to navigate to the cloned Papy directory:
```bash
cd Papy
```

You will need functional build system. In the case of Papy I used makefile to build the project. You can determine if you have make installed by using:
```bash
make --version
```
![Make version](documentationImages/makeVersion.png "Make version")

The command to build Papy is the following once you are in the project root directory. 
```bash
make build
```
![Make build](documentationImages/makeBuild.png "Make build")

### Initial Setup
Now we got Papy up built and ready for you! Lets get our hands on it now. After the build the Papy Binary/executable will be in the `bin` directory.

Navigate to the `Papy/bin` directory:
```bash
cd bin
```

Papy will be in the `bin` directory. Run the Papy help command to get a sense of what flags you can make use of and to verify that papy was built successfully.
```bash
./papy --help
```
![Papy help](documentationImages/papyHelp.png "Papy help")

### First Steps
Lets launch some requests! The following are examples of possible use cases and the commands that would go along with them. Papy is highly configurable though so there are many more possible configurations depending on what you are trying to achieve.

If you want to launch a bunch of GET requests to a specific site:
```bash
./papy --threads 4 --target "https://www.google.com"
```
![Papy GET](documentationImages/papyGET.gif "Papy GET")

If you want to send a static payload from a JSON file then simply specify the file path to your JSON file. The following command looks to the directory structure `../archive/mappingFiles/testPayload.json` for example to send `testPayload.json` as the body of the POST requests. This command also displays the functionality of the `--rate` flag which rate limits the requests by adding a delay of X milliseconds between each request.
```bash
./papy --threads 1 --target "http://10.0.0.7" --endpoint "/printJson" --payload "../archive/mappingFiles/testPayload.json" --rate 2000
```
The contents of `testPayload.json` are as follows:
```json
{
    "overrides": {
        "business_unit" : {
            "name" : "BOB"
        },
        "application" : {
            "name" : "BOB"
        },
        "project" : {
            "name" : "BOB"
        }
    }
}

```

> **Note:** The bottom terminal is a locally deployed web application that prints the body of its received POST requests for demonstration purposes. As you can see the payload that is being sent is the same payload that is being received by the Python web server.

The following is an example of me testing the database of a locally deployed web application I created called [M-Track](https://github.com/noahpop77/M-Track). This execution run will use the randomized payload generation for League of Legends. The lol payload will trigger a class in the tool to generate a randomized League of Legends match file and send that to the API endpoint of [M-Track](https://github.com/noahpop77/M-Track).
```bash
./papy --threads 4 --target "http://10.0.0.7" --endpoint "/addMatch" --payload lol
```

## User Interface 
Since this was designed to be simple as well as a Command Line Interface tool the UI follows this paradigm. You can see the UI information of Papy with any exeuction of the Papy command like:
```bash
./papy [Flag] {Value} [Flag] {Value} [Flag] {Value} ...
```

## Notable Command Line Arguments

### --threads [num]
This parameter lets you specify the amount of CPU threads you want to use for the programs execution. The more you add the more concurrent requests will be sent. If you try to assign more threads that you have physically then the speed will not necessarily increase due to the CPU having to switch between the active tasks anyways so there is no real point to assigning more threads that you physically have on your CPU. Faster threads however do assist in the speed of requests per thread.

### --target [url]
Assigns the url of the target. Should be in the format `http://www.mtrack.com`. Specifically the `http://` or `https://` portion of the address must be included. This is because this is how Papy determines which protocols to use to send the requests. 

### --endpoint [path]
Specifies the endpoint of the specific server. This endpoint string gets appended to the target address. So if you want to query the target `https://www.mtrack.com` and the endpoint `/addMatch` you can use the command:
```bash
./papy --threads 1 --target "https://www.mtrack.com" --endpoint "/addMatch"
```

### --parameter [string]
The `--parameter` flag lets you specify end of URL paramaters. For example, the following Papy command will yield the final url of `https://www.mtrack.com/addMatch?variable=BOB`.
```bash
./papy --threads 1 --target "https://www.mtrack.com" --endpoint "/addMatch" --parameter "?variable=BOB"
```

### --count [num]
This parameter will let you specify the amount of payloads that each thread will launch. If you have a single thread and specify `--count` to be 10 then Papy will launch 10 requests. If you however have `--threads` set to 4 and you have `--count` set to 10 it will launch 40 requests. The count number is FOR EACH THREAD.  

### --rate [ms]
`--rate` specifies the delay in milliseconds between payloads being sent out. If you specify `--rate 2000` then there will be a 2 secon delay between each set of packets being sent out. Once again if you have the threadcount set to 4 and a delay of 2000 then 4 packets will be sent out every 2 seconds. The delay is also per thread.


### --verbose
This flag has no parameter. If it is present in the command line arguments it will enable verbose output. It will show you the response of each request being sent out. Without this flag all you will see in terms of the responses of the requests is the main statistics line for Papy.
```
Total Sent: 36 | Successful: 36 | Failed: 0 | Packets/s: 1 | Elapsed Time: 70099
```

### --spike [ms]
This flag lets you specify a "spike" time. What happens is that whatever delay in ms you set for this flag will be used to calculate when the payloads will be sent out. Each request will be sent out at a random delay between zero and the number that you set. This makes the traffic much more chaotic and similar to real world situations.

### --ramp [ms]
This flag lets you specify test a ramping simulation. The traffic will have a delay of the one you set for the `--ramp` flag and then get halved each time a payload is sent. It will ramp faster and faster until it runs at the max speed capable of your hardware.

### --payload [num]
This is where a good amount of the meat of the functionality is. Depending on the payload that you set you will have behavior vary drastically. At the moment there are 4 main operating modes:
- No payload
- `lol`
- `{filepath}`
  - ex. `./home/jsonFiles/bob.json`

If no payload is set then Papy will send GET requests to the specified address and endpoint.

If `lol` is set then it will generate a custom pseudo-random payload based off the specifications in a custom class. 

If a file path is specified then Papy will look for a JSON file and parse it. That parsed JSON will then be used as a body for the payload.
